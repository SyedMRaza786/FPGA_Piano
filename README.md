# FPGA Pianno

## You have stumbled upon my Github! Enjoy! ðŸ‘¾

My team and I replicated the song Despacito through an FPGA Piano. We programmed a Diligent Basis 3 Artix-7 FPGA board to send the chosen frequencies aligning with the musical notes of the Despacito song. Used VHDL to code this project.
