# FPGA Piano
My team and I replicated the song Despacito through an FPGA Piano. We programmed a Diligent Basis 3 Artix-7 FPGA board to send the chosen frequencies aligning with the musical notes of the Despacito song. Used VHDL to code this project. For more information, please read this on my portfolio
